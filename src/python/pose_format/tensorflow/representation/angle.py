        Computes the angle of the X/Y axis between two points.

        Parameters
        ----------
        p1s : tf.Tensor
            First set of points with shape (Points, Batch, Len, Dims).
        p2s : tf.Tensor
            Second set of points with shape (Points, Batch, Len, Dims).

        Returns
        -------
        tf.Tensor
            A tensor representing the angle of the X/Y axis between two points
            with shape (Points, Batch, Len).
        
        Note
        -----
        The function computes the difference between the two point sets, 
        splits the difference into X and Y components, and then calculates 
        the slope and the angle using the arctan function. 
        If the x difference is zero, the function returns a result that 
        avoids NaN by using `tf.math.divide_no_nan`.
