def get_vectors_norm(vectors):

    Computes the normalized version of the input vectors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vectors : tf.Tensor
        A tensor containing vectors.

    Returns
    -------
    tf.Tensor
        The normalized vectors.

    Notes
    -----
    This function transposes the input vectors, computes the magnitude (norm) 
    of the vectors, and then returns the normalized version by dividing 
    each vector by its magnitude.

        """
        Computes the angle at point `p2s` for the triangle formed by `p1s`, `p2s`, and `p3s`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        p1s : tf.Tensor
            First set of points with shape (Points, Batch, Len, Dims).
        p2s : tf.Tensor
            Second set of points, where the angle is formed, 
            with shape (Points, Batch, Len, Dims).
        p3s : tf.Tensor
            Third set of points with shape (Points, Batch, Len, Dims).

        Returns
        -------
        tf.Tensor
            A tensor representing the angle (in radians) at point `p2s` 
            for the triangle with shape (Points, Batch, Len).
        
        Note
        -----
        This method determines the vectors pointing towards `p1s` and `p3s` 
        from the point `p2s`, normalizes these vectors, and then computes 
        the dot product between them. The angle between these vectors is 
        computed using the arccosine function on the dot product.
