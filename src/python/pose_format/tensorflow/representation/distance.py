        Parameters
        ----------
        p1s : tf.Tensor
            First set of points with shape (Points, Batch, Len, Dims).

        tf.Tensor
            A tensor representing the Euclidean distance between the two points 
            with shape (Points, Batch, Len).

        -----
        The function computes the difference between the two sets of points,
        squares the differences, sums the squared differences along the last axis,
        and then takes the square root to calculate the Euclidean distance.
